# Maximize Stock Profit Solver

This repository contains a solution to the problem of finding the maximum profit from a single stock transaction, given daily stock prices. The objective is to determine the best day to buy and the best future day to sell to achieve the highest profit. If no profit is possible, the solution should return 0.

## Problem Overview

Given an array `prices` where each element represents the stock price on a particular day, the goal is to identify the optimal buying and selling points that maximize profit. The function must ensure that the buying day precedes the selling day.

### Example

**Input:** prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** The optimal strategy is to buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), resulting in a profit of 5.

In contrast, an input like [7,6,4,3,1] would yield an output of 0, indicating that no profitable transactions could be made.
